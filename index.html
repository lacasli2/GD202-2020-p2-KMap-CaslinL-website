      <p ><strong>Talley is incredibly multi-purposeful and a clear central hub of campus.</strong> Talley’s environment is incredibly diverse which calls for the actions of its users to be incredibly diverse. Although the space wasn’t clearly intentionally a workspace, many users’ actions reflect it to be either a study space or use it primarily for eating/relaxing. Some use Talley as a place they often go by themselves while others use it primarily as a social space. Whether students areeating, resting, socializing, or working, the Talley environment sets up clear social cues and behaviors that both limit and encourage student productivity within the space.</p>
